# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)

Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. 
Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 0

Create a GitHub repository with a suitable description.

## Homework 1

Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the led). In order to complete this task I used 3 potentiometers, 1 RGB led, 1 bread board, 3 resistors (220 Ohms), 1 Arduino UNO board and connectivity wires. I implemented the code used to control the led in Arduino IDE 2.

The code, image and video showcasing the RGB led being controlled are provided in the Homework1 file (in case you don,t want to download the video i have provided a youtube link: https://youtu.be/ouFXPSiqGA0).
